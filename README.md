# Full-Stack Developer Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Full-Stack Developer coding challenge! This challenge aims to assess your skills and problem-solving abilities in building a basic Virtual Product Management (VPM) Dashboard.

## The Project

In this coding challenge, you will be tasked with the following:

1. Utilize the provided Postman collection to retrieve product details for the country UAE. Note that an access token is required for authentication.

2. Persist the obtained product data in a backend database of your choice. Each data point should correspond to a column in the database.

3. Develop a backend API that the frontend application can call. This API should provide product details and authenticate user credentials.

4. Implement a user registration and login page. Users should be able to create new accounts or log in using existing credentials. User passwords and credentials should be securely stored in the database.

5. Create a main page/dashboard to display the product data in a well-formatted manner. Users should be able to add, update, and delete product details.

## Requirements

### Git

- Maintain your code using Git, preferably on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
- Commit your code with descriptive commit messages.
- Create feature branches for each push, organizing them by functionality (e.g., registration, dashboard).
- Introduce and resolve a deliberate conflict.

### Backend

- You have the freedom to choose any language or framework for the project.
- Persist the product data and user credentials in a database.
  - Ensure that each data point has a corresponding column in the database.
  - Feel free to use any database tool you prefer, such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.
- Develop a backend API that provides frontend applications with product details and verifies user credentials.

### Frontend

- Implement the frontend using React, Vue, or Angular. You can utilize the CLI generators of these frameworks (e.g., npx create-react-app, ng new my-app, etc.) to bootstrap your project.
- Login Page Requirements:
  - Authentication is required to access the application.
  - Users must register for a new account or log in with existing credentials to access the dashboard.
- Main Page/Dashboard Requirements:
  - The dashboard should display the product data in a clean and organized manner.
  - Users should be able to add, delete, and update product details.
